    <h1>Life</h1>
    <div class="page">
        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Life is interesting.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There will be a time when you feel, it's over.</li>
                <li>You are not created here in this earth just to give up your life.</li>
                <li>Don't over-blame yourself for the mistakes around you or yourself.</li>
                <li>We humans learn through mistakes.</li>
                <li>Always keep in mind that time will heal you eventually.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Don't be too overwhelmed by anything in this world.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can't win this world but you can help yourself understand where you stand.</li>
                <li>I made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I never give up to learn or be better.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, there won't be any hope left in this world.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Always be content</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember there is no such a thing as I have enough in this world.</li>
                <li>So be content of what you have or what you are granted by God.</li>
                <li>You don't know what will happen tomorrow.</li>
                <li>Until today, there is no service where we can raise dead people.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Wisdom, Knowledge, Understanding</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowledge is power but without wisdom that knowledge itself is a danger to you.</li>
                <li>Understanding is the one of the most important requirements we should have as a human being.</li>
                <li>The truth shall set you free.</li>
                <li>If you feel like your life is worthless, reconsider what you believe or change what you have come to believe and find another path.</li>
            </ul>
